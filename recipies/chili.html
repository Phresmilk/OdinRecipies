    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chili is actually one of my favorite foods and I make it all the time. It’s a recipe everyone in the family loves and it’s just good for the soul, perfect comfort food. This slow cooker method is my favorite for chili. The flavor of the crockpot chili is rich and robust, the texture of the beef is so tender, and it turns out perfect every time! It’s just the way the ground beef in chili should be. Six hours of slow cooking creates the best chili ever! And have I mentioned how easy this it is to make? It’s a total breeze, so this will likely become a recipe you won’t want to lose!</p>
