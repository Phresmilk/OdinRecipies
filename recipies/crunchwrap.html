    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crunchwrap Supremes are loaded with seasoned ground beef, nacho cheese, sour cream and more all wrapped inside a flour tortilla. There is a corn tortilla hidden inside that gives it that crunch we all love!</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (1.25-ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
    <li>4 (12-inch) flour tortillas</li>
    <li>1/2 cup nacho cheese</li>
    <li>4 tostada shells</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>
        2 cups shredded lettuce
    </li>
    <li>1 Roma tomato, diced</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese</li>
</ul>
<ol><strong><em>Steps</em></strong>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; stir in taco seasoning. Drain excess fat; set aside.</li>
<li>Heat tortillas according to package instructions.</li>
<li>Heat nacho cheese according to package instructions.</li>
<li>Working one at a time, place ground beef mixture in the center of each tortilla. Top with nacho cheese and tostada shell. Spread sour cream in an even layer over the tostada shell; top with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
<li>Fold the edges up and over the center. Continue to work your way around the tortilla, folding as tight as possible.</li>
<li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Place wrap seam-side down and cook until the underside is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook wrap on the other side, about 1-2 minutes longer.</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li></ol>
